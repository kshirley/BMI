This repository contains the R code used in the data analysis presented in the
paper <a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21318/abstract'>
"How well does the standard body mass index or variations with a
different exponent predict human lifespan?"</a> by Dean Foster, Howard Karloff,
and Kenneth E. Shirley, to appear in the journal Obesity in early 2016.

We are unable to share the data, unfortunately, but if you have any questions or comments about the analysis code, please raise an issue in this GitHub
repository.
